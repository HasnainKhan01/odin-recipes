Project Intro:
In this project I will be creating a basic recipe website using only HTML.
Once this project is completed I will show competency in using HTML and how to structure a webpage and use the various tags
in HTML properly like headers, body, lists, images, etc. I will also know how to link different webpages to each other and open
them in a new tab. Lastly I will know how to host the project on the web so it's accesible to other people.
